                <h3>The Tissue Blanket Killer (TBK)</h3>
                <p>Also known as Acustragulum (Latin fusion for "needle and blanket"), this is Heiki's most notorious case which lasted for two years. The killer harvested individual tissues from victims, keeping them in pink buckets to create human tissue blankets. By the time Heiki confronted him, Acustragulum had already sold over 9,000 blankets (each requiring three 5'5" people). Heiki discovered 94 unsold blankets at the crime scene, with the killer working on a 95th.</p>
                <p>This is the only criminal Heiki has ever killed, resulting in severe injuries including damage to his shoulder that left a massive scar.</p>

            <div class="case-card">
                <h3>The Dancer Case</h3>
                <p>What began as a simple request from a father to help his crying dancer son evolved into one of Heiki's deepest cases, as the dancer was suffering from depression and anxiety.</p>

                <p>Heiki found a child's stolen chocolate in a kidnapper's pocket, leading to the discovery that the criminal was planning to use the treats to lure the child. The kidnapper had stolen all the child's chocolate as part of his plan.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">When his coping mechanisms fail, Heiki simply smiles and gives up temporarily, saving his breakdown for his next rooftop "scream session." If caught during one of these sessions, he freezes completely before deflecting by scolding the protagonist for being awake past bedtime.</p>

            <div class="tbk-section">
                <p>The final confrontation with Acustragulum (TBK) was one of the most harrowing experiences of Heiki's career:</p>
                
                <h3>The Raid</h3>
                <p>Heiki led a squad of six officers into TBK's hideout. They split up with officers checking the basement and upper floors while Heiki remained on the main floor. Soon after separating, screams echoed through the building. Using an echolocation device, Heiki discovered one officer with their head separated from their body, meticulously cleaned of blood. More screams followed as the remaining officers were eliminated one by one.</p>
                
                <h3>The Confrontation</h3>
                <p>Following the sound of a needle at work, Heiki entered a room to find TBK arranging a blanket made of skin while extracting tissues from a pink bucket. The killer's face was embedded with needles. When Heiki ordered him to surrender, TBK merely asked "say please?" before throwing a needle into Heiki's leg, dragging him across the room using yarn, shooting each of his fingers individually, and throwing him across the room.</p>
                
                <h3>The Pursuit</h3>
                <p>Despite severe injuries, Heiki's adrenaline kept him going. He threw a corkboard at TBK, who stitched up his own wounds before fleeing to the roof. Heiki pursued him up the stairs despite his injuries.</p>
                
                <h3>The Final Showdown</h3>
                <p>On the roof, TBK threw a human-tissue blanket at Heiki, triggering traumatic recognition of the smell. As TBK attempted to jump-attack him, Heiki punched him in the face, knocking out several teeth including canines. TBK stabbed these teeth into Heiki's spinal cord, paralyzing parts of his body while saying "you could have said please..."</p>
                
                <h3>The Kill</h3>
                <p>With parts of his body paralyzed, Heiki drew a hidden second gun and shot TBK directly in the heart. As his body gave out, Heiki fell from the five-story building. TBK's final words were "you could have let me finish the 95th one and then killed me."</p>
                
                <h3>The Rescue</h3>
                <p>Xa Yoho, Heiki's assistant, caught him mid-air despite having a fractured arm himself, saving Heiki's life in a dramatic fashion.</p>
